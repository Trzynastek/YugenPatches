YungenPatches is a Firefox extension that modifies the YungenAnime website.

What it does:
- Adds "My List" to the navbar.
- Displays animes with unwatched episodes first in the watch list.
- Adds a green dot next to animes with unwatched episodes in the watch list.
- Changes the click behavior of animes in the watch list to go to the last watched episode instead of the anime page.
